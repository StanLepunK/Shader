## Filter
This little project can be use too show easily video or image and apply glsl filter on it.

Few glsl shader are available like gaussian blur, circular blur, radial blur, reaction diffusion, change spectrum HSB, RGB slit, dithering, grain, halftone, halftone line, scale,warp procedurale, warp texture, pixelate...
All shaders can be usue on a specific PGraphics or on the main rendering, obviously it's faster to use them on main render 'g'.
