## Shader
This project is a processing framework to customize your background via the glsl shader or to filtering your rendering.
there is a collection of background shader and more important collection of post fx filtering.

For POST FX the shader available is gaussian blur, circular blur, radial blur, reaction diffusion, change spectrum HSB, RGB slit, dithering, grain, halftone, halftone line, scale,warp procedurale, warp texture, pixelate...
All shaders can be use on a specific PGraphics or on the main rendering, obviously it's faster to use them on main render 'g'.

## rope library
to use filter and all the tap of rope method you need to download Rope library
